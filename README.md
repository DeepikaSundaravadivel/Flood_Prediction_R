# Flood_Prediction_R
A machine learning project using R to predict flood probability based on weather data.
This project focuses on predicting the probability of floods based on multiple environmental and climatic factors using the R programming language. By analyzing rainfall, temperature, humidity, monsoon intensity, soil type, and river water levels, the model identifies patterns that indicate a higher risk of flooding.

The goal of this project is to support early warning systems and help in disaster preparedness and resource allocation.

## Steps
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
3. Evaluation
