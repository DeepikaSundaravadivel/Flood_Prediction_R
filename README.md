# Flood Prediction using R

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **probability of floods** based on environmental and climatic factors using R.  
By analyzing rainfall, temperature, humidity, monsoon intensity, and water levels, the model identifies patterns indicating flood risk.  
It aims to help in **disaster preparedness and resource management**.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze flood-related data using R.  
- Build predictive models to estimate flood probability.  
- Visualize trends and correlations between weather features.  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and ROC metrics.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Import:** Load dataset using `read.csv()`.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data.  
3. **EDA:** Visualize relationships using `ggplot2`.  
4. **Modeling:** Use Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  
5. **Evaluation:** Compare model accuracy and visualize ROC curve.
